Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction. 
Online marketing is growing day by day and has become a billion-dollar industry. Companies spend a lot of money in an effort to target users who visit their website once, to encourage them to buy products from their website. But a major part of the revenue comes from only 20% of the users. So instead of targeting everyone who visits the website, marketing budget can better be utilized, if they target only those users who are most likely to purchase a product in the future. Google Merchandise Store is an online Google products store that has provided the dataset of their website to help us predict customers who are most likely to make a transaction in the future, and the total revenue they will earn from that customer. This data was collected by Google Analytics, and the same model can be used by anyone who is using Google Analytics. The goal of this project is to use various machine learning algorithms to predict the estimated total revenue the website will earn from a user who visits their website.
